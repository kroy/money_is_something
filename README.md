#Money Is Something
##### by kroy

This is a webapp that uses the [Sunlight Foundation's congressional data](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/), accessed through its APIs, 
to help users visualize and understand the impact of money in our government. Although other sites 
do this, I believe that there is something missing with respect to the analysis of the direct impact 
money has (or doesn't have...) on votes and legislative actions.

Money doesn't explain everything that congress does (or doesn't do), but it explains *some* of 
what our legislature does. Money is something.
